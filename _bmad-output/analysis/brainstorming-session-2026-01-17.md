facilitation_notes: "User has provided deep technical and operational context. We have defined a specific 'Expert Agent' architecture (Stellar-Jarvis) that sits as an orchestration layer on top of the Co-Pilot Next.js app. The core logic is defined as 'Active Observation' triggering 'Defensive' and 'Offensive' patterns."

# Session Overview

**Topic:** Stellar-Jarvis Agent Definition
**Goals:** Define a "Desk Architect" & "Process Optimizer" agent for the Stellar Recruitment Co-Pilot.
**Key Capabilities:**
*   **System Integration:** Intelligence layer for the Co-Pilot dashboard.
*   **Process Audit:** Analyze and optimize recruitment workflows (Google Sheets/Microsoft ecosystem).
*   **Financial Strategy:** Optimize "Temp Desk" ROI, commissions, and "Build Your Own Desk" strategy.
*   **Market Intelligence:** NZ Construction specific (Trades, Regions: Auckland/Waikato/BOP/Northland).
*   **Persona:** Proactive, "Jarvis-like", authoritative but helpful, "Active Observer".

### Context Guidance
Leveraging the **Co-Pilot** architecture (Next.js, DataContext, Google Sheets Sync), this agent will act as the proactive brain sitting on top of the existing "Predictive Command Center." It bridges the gap between raw data (The Scoreboard, Mission Control) and actionable strategic advice.

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

**Thematic Organization:**

**Theme 1: The Persona (Soul)**
*Focus: A "Seasoned Recruiter" who knows the trade.*
*   **Attributes:** High-status, proactive, site-literate (L4 Formworker vs Handyman).
*   **Voice:** "Blue Collar Translator" - bridges site slang with strategic data.

**Theme 2: The Architecture (Body)**
*Focus: Tech Stack Integration.*
*   **Core:** Next.js 16 App with centralized `DataContext`.
*   **Data:** `google-sheets.js` (Sync), `construction-logic.js` (Trade Rules).
*   **UI Hooks:** Redeployment Radar, Hunter Deck, Golden Hour Mode.
*   **Orchestration:** Agent listens to `DataContext` changes to trigger events.

**Theme 3: The Operations (Brain)**
*Focus: Logic Engines & workflows.*
*   **Financials:** 2026 Auckland Forecasts (Budget vs Actuals).
*   **Compliance:** Rigid "Hard Stops" (Credit, Inductions, MOJ).
*   **Sourcing:** Filipino Migrant Pipeline & Trade Testing.
*   **Desk Pulse:** Daily tracking of Finishing vs Top Up.

**Theme 4: Orchestration Patterns (Actions)**
*   **Defensive (Active Guardrail):** "Crisis Interceptor" - Auto-resolves no-shows, enforces hard stops.
*   **Offensive (Rainmaker):** Converts risks (weather) into opportunities (indoor upsells).

**Prioritization Results:**

- **Top Priority Ideas:**
    1.  **Expert Agent Architecture:** Required for holding the deep context of Forecasts and Hard Stops.
    2.  **Active Observer Hook:** The technical integration point with `DataContext`.
    3.  **Crisis Interceptor:** The MVP "Defensive" capability.

**Action Planning:**

1.  **Define Agent Spec:** Formalize as an **Expert Agent**.
2.  **Build Agent:** Configure with "Desk Architect" role and specific tools.
3.  **Integrate:** Implement the "Active Guardrail" logic.

## Session Summary and Insights

**Key Achievements:**
- Defined the "Stellar-Jarvis" archetype as a specific **Expert Agent**.
- Mapped the **Defensive** (Guardrail) and **Offensive** (Rainmaker) logic to specific API routes and Context states.
- Established the "Seasoned Recruiter" persona to ensure high adoption.

**Session Reflections:**
The user is ready to move from concept to code. The distinction between the "Body" (App) and "Brain" (Agent) is crystal clear.
