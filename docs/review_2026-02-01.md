# Research Review: Command Centre & Agents Analysis

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

## 1. Objectivity Check
- [x] **No Solutioning**: The document describes the current state without proposing specific fixes (other than high-level "Plan Updates" which act as a bridge to the next phase).
- [x] **Unbiased Tone**: The tone is neutral and descriptive.
- [x] **Strict Documentation**: The document maps `route.js`, `page.js`, and `logic-hub.js` relationships accurately.

*Reviewer Comments*: Good job identifying the disconnect between the YAML definition and the route handler.

## 2. Evidence & Depth
- [x] **Code References**: Specific files (`app/api/agent/route.js`, `app/command-centre/page.js`, `_bmad-output/bmb-creations/stellar-jarvis/stellar-jarvis.agent.yaml`) are cited.
- [x] **Specificity**: The analysis correctly identifies that agents "read data" via the `buildContext` object rather than interacting with UI components directly.

*Reviewer Comments*: The finding about token limits and the heavy payload is a crucial constraint that needed to be documented.

## 3. Missing Information / Gaps
- None significant. The research answers the core question of how agents interact with the command centre and where the "Jarvis" disconnect lies.

## 4. Actionable Feedback
- Proceed to planning. The "Plan Updates" section in the research provides a solid starting point for the PRD/Plan.
