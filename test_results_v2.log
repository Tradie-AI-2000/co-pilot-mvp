[user]: [GM]: To assess if we are hitting our margin targets, I need a detailed financial analysis. I'll transfer this to the Accountant for a comprehensive report.

[Accountant]: Here's a snapshot of our financial health:

*   **Gross Margin:** \$15,788 (23.82%). Revenue is \$66,280.
*   **Payroll Liability:** \$50,492 (based on 36 headcount and 1.3x burden).
*   **"Busy Fool" Alert:** Joe Ward flagged with a Net GP of \$396 (below the \$400 threshold). This deal needs immediate review!

[user]: [CandidateMgr]: OK. I ran the squad builder for Auckland, but no squads were generated. This could be due to a lack of available candidates in that region matching the 1 Senior + 2 Juniors criteria. I'll need to investigate the candidate pool in Auckland to see what's available. Can you tell me which roles you are looking for?
